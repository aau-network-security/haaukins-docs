The main goal of this challenge is to let the user understand how an XSS works and also how is possible to retrieve data managing the URL.
On this challenge the user has to find three flags (the order doesn't matter):

**Prerequisite:**
- Know how an Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) works

## Heartbleed

**Points:** ​ 16 **Difficulty:** ​Easy

**Learning Objectives:**
- Achieve confidence using the Metasploit framework
- Understand that also encrypted web traffic (HTTPS) can be exploited

**Description:** ​In this challenge, the HAAUKINS user is expected to complete an attack
abusing the famous Heartbleed Bug, that is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL
cryptographic software library. This bug allows an attacker to access information otherwise
protected by SSL/TLS encryption. The user is expected to gather information about
conducting a Heartbleed attack from Google, and subsequently configure a Metasploit
session to complete the exploit. The target host should be determined through an active
network scan.

**Prerequisite:**
- Fundamentals in Linux terminal
- Knowing what Metasploit is and its capabilities

## Cross-Site Request Forgery

**Points:** ​ 36 **Difficulty:** ​Medium

**Learning Objectives:**
- Gain a basic understanding of web APIs

**Description:** ​In this challenge the user is expected to utilise knowledge about web service
communication. After registering on the website the user should figure out that the people in
the chat is clicking on all links send. After realising this the user should use knowledge about
web APIs to create a link that will get the other users to send money in order to buy the flag.

## Phishing

### Convince visitation of URL

**Points:** ​ 48 **Difficulty:** ​Medium

**Learning Objectives:**
- Introduction to mail servers and protocols as ‘Simple Mail Transfer Protocol’, SMTP.
- Mail clients and how to forward emails through a STMP server in a terminal.
- Capturing POST requests

**Description:** ​Social Engineering including spear phishing emails is very popular in the
hacking community, because it’s a lot easier to hack a person than a computer. In this
challenge the HAAUKINS user shall try to trick a person into visiting a website of his choice.
In order to do that the user needs to know who to target; the first goal is to do some recon on
the network and websites. The next step is to send the target an email with an URL.
Haaukins is a closed environment and the user will need to use a mail server running on the
network. The participants can see various flags (through traffic analysis) being exposed as
they conduct phishing against an email listed on the web server.

**Prerequisite:**
- It’s necessary to know how an SMTP server works and how to find services on a network
like web server and SMTP server (challenge 1.2).


### Impersonate colleague

**Points:** ​ 58 **Difficulty:** ​Medium

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to send a phishing email

**Description:** ​This is phishing challenge in which the user shall try to trick a person into
visiting a website of his choice. In order to do that the user has to find the destination email
by looking the network and the website. The user should let the destination email understand
that the email is from the same domain in order to get the flag.

**Prerequisite:**
- [Convince visitation of URL](#convince-visitation-of-url)

### Abuse Credentials

**Points:** ​ 33 **Difficulty:** ​Easy

**Learning Objectives:**
- Introduction to mail servers and protocols as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- Setup a simple web server with a custom HTML script

**Description:** ​If a you can get a person to visit your website, maybe you can get him to input
credentials and hand it over to you? In this challenge the user will continue working on
phishing, but he will learn that it’s a lot more than just sending some emails to important
people. He will need to trick them into passing confidential information without suspicion. He
can do this by cloning a website the victim is trusting and trick him visit it.

**Prerequisite:**
- [Convince visitation of URL](#convince-visitation-of-url)
- [Impersonate colleague](#impersonate-colleague)

## Hijack Domain

**Points:** ​ 70 **Difficulty:** ​Very hard

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how spoofing works
- ARP Protocol

**Description:** ​This is a phishing challenge in which the user has to hijack the challenge
domain. The user should redirect the traffic of the legitimate website to the kali machine in
order to get the flag.

**Prerequisite:**
- [Convince visitation of URL](#convince-visitation-of-url)
- [Impersonate colleague](#impersonate-colleague)

## Cross-Site Scripting

**Points:** ​ 55 **Difficulty:** ​Medium

**Learning Objectives:**
- Learn how to gain unauthorized access on a website

**Description:** ​The challenge consists of two machines a server and a client. The server hosts
a website with a comment section which is vulnerable to injecting JavaScript. The users has
to use the section in order to steal the session cookie from the client, which visits the site
from time to time. When they have stolen the cookie, then they can use it to gain authorized
access and find the flag.

- Know how the cookies work

## Unauthenticated ​Access

**Points:** ​ 20 **Difficulty:** ​Hard

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understanding of how HTTP headers works and how to manipulate them in order to get
remote code execution access.

**Description:** ​The challenge provides to the user a website in which is installed an old
version of Joomla. This CMS suffers from an unauthenticated remote code execution that
affects all versions from 1.5.0 to 3.4.5. It means any file on server can be accessible by
sending commands, so in order to get flag from the server, users should be able to search
for it and then read it.

**Prerequisite:**
- Knowledge about HTTP requests and headers
- Familiarity to Metasploit modules

## Remote Access

**Points:** ​ 65 **Difficulty:** ​Very hard

**Learning Objectives:**
- Know how to use cURL
