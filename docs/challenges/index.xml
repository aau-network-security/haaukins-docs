Shrunk-Chunk Heap Overflow Binary Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way that is advantageous to the attacker. It comes down by abusing vulnerabilities that corrupt memory in software or by finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it in order to escalate privileges.</description></item><item><title>Cryptography</title><link>/docs/challenges/cryptography/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>/docs/challenges/cryptography/</guid><description>Cryptography Difficulty Levels JS Crypto Client MD5 Collision Course Lurking in the shadows SSH Vigenère Vignette Cryptography The main goal is usually to crack or clone cryptographic objects or algorithms to reach the flag.
Difficulty Levels The levels of difficulty scale is based on the number of steps required in order to solve the Training Challenge

Domain name If the challenge does not have NMAP as a part of the challenge, the general rule of thumb is, that it should have a domain name. This is to easily distinguish challenges from each other when there is a lot of them running on the platform. The domain name should then also be included in the challenge description(s) for the user to easily access the challenge.</description></item><item><title>How to Create A Challenge</title><link>/docs/challenges/how-to-create-chal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 13:26:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>/docs/challenges/how-to-create-chal/</guid><description>Creating a Challenge A challenge is created as a subfolder in its category folder. A sample challenge folder is sample/piece_of_pie/ with the contents below:
example/challenge_1/ |-- README.md |-- Dockerfile |-- .gitlab-ci.yml |-- tests `-- test_exploit.py |-- sol/ | `-- exploit.py |-- config (or src) / |-- auto.conf |-- init.sh As above, the challenge folder must have: * The challenge folder should contain following information and main README.md file. You can follow Challenge Repository Structure for an example of how the readme file should be setup for your challenge;</description></item></channel></rss>
